# Fixes — 2025-12-18

## Task 1 — Signup failed (SettingsThrottle signature mismatch)

**What changed**
- Reverted auth throttling to Laravel’s built-in middleware (`throttle:6,1`) and removed the settings-based throttle middleware that caused auth crashes.

**Files touched**
- `routes/api.php`
- `routes/auth.php`
- `bootstrap/app.php`
- `tests/Feature/RegistrationThrottleApiTest.php`

**How to verify**
- Run tests: `php artisan test --filter=RegistrationThrottleApiTest`
- Or manually: `POST /api/register` should return `201` (or validation errors), and never `500`.

## Task 2 — Pest Control services

**Rolled back**
- Removed the dedicated Pest Control seeder so the catalog goes back to the prior seeding behavior.
